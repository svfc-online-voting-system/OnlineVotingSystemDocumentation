## Database Architecture

### Data Dictionary

---

**Administrators Table**

-   **admin_id**: This is a unique identifier for each administrator. It is automatically generated and serves as the primary key of the table.
-   **user_id**: This column links each administrator to a user account in the "Users" table, ensuring that every administrator has a valid user profile. The relationship is enforced through a foreign key constraint, meaning the administrator's details are tied to existing users.

---

**Ballots Table**

-   **ballot_id**: A unique identifier for each ballot cast in the system. It automatically increments to ensure every ballot has a distinct ID.
-   **user_id**: Represents the individual voter who submitted the ballot, linking back to the "Users" table to keep track of who has voted.
-   **vote_type_id**: This column identifies the type of vote, such as a poll or an election. It connects to the "Vote Types" table to ensure clarity on what kind of voting process the ballot was part of.
-   **submitted_at**: A timestamp that records exactly when the ballot was submitted, ensuring traceability for auditing and transparency.

---

**Audit Logs Table**

-   **log_id**: A unique identifier for each audit log entry, automatically generated to keep the logs distinct.
-   **vote_id**: Connects each audit log to a specific vote through a foreign key, allowing for detailed tracking of actions performed on a particular vote.
-   **action**: Describes the specific action that was taken on a vote, such as "vote cast" or "vote invalidated."
-   **timestamp**: Records the precise time when the action in the log occurred, providing accountability for any changes or events that took place.

---

**Poll Options Table**

-   **option_id**: A unique identifier for each poll option. This ensures each option in a poll can be uniquely referenced.
-   **poll_id**: Links each poll option to a specific poll in the system. This foreign key relationship guarantees that the option belongs to a legitimate poll.
-   **option_text**: The text that describes the option available for selection in the poll, such as a candidate's name or a choice in a survey.

---

**Profile Table**

-   **user_id**: The primary key of the table, which is also linked to the "Users" table. It ensures that each profile is associated with a valid user account.
-   **username**: A unique name chosen by the user that will be used for login or public identification purposes.
-   **email**: The user's email address, which is required for communication and system notifications.
-   **first_name** and **last_name**: These fields store the user's real first and last names for more formal identification.
-   **date_of_birth**: A required field that records the user's birthdate, often used for verification or demographic analysis.
-   **account_creation_date**: This field captures when the user's account was first created in the system, ensuring a timeline for their activity.

---

**Users Table**

-   **user_id**: A unique identifier for each user in the system. It is the primary key and is automatically incremented to ensure uniqueness.
-   **salt**: A random string added to the user's password before it is hashed to enhance security.
-   **hashed_password**: The user’s encrypted password, stored in a secure, hashed format.
-   **otp_secret** and **otp_expiry**: These columns store information for one-time passwords (OTPs), which are used for two-factor authentication. The secret generates the OTP, and the expiry dictates how long the OTP is valid.
-   **reset_token** and **reset_expiry**: These columns handle password reset functionality by storing tokens and their expiration times.
-   **verified_account**: A flag that indicates whether a user has verified their account (1 for yes, 0 for no).
-   **verification_token** and **verification_expiry**: These fields store the token sent to users for account verification and the deadline for using it.

---

**Poll Votes Table**
- **poll_vote_id**: A unique identifier for each poll vote entry. It automatically increments to ensure distinction among votes.
- **vote_id**: Links the poll vote to the specific vote cast in the system, with a foreign key reference to the "Votes" table.
- **option_id**: Connects the poll vote to the selected option from the "Poll Options" table, allowing for tracking of individual selections.

---

**Electoral Votes Table**
- **electoral_vote_id**: A unique identifier for each electoral vote entry. It automatically increments to distinguish between different votes.
- **vote_id**: Links the electoral vote to the specific vote cast in the system, with a foreign key reference to the "Votes" table.
- **candidate_id**: Links the electoral vote to the corresponding candidate in the system, ensuring clarity on whom the vote is for.
- **vote_timestamp**: Captures the exact moment when the electoral vote was cast, providing transparency and enabling precise tracking of voting actions.

---

**Vote Types Table**

-   **vote_type_id**: A unique identifier for each type of vote, automatically generated for uniqueness.
-   **type_name**: This column indicates whether the vote is part of a "poll" or an "electoral" process, distinguishing between different types of voting scenarios.
-   **title**: This column shows the title for specific vote, be it electoral and poll type.

---

**Votes Table**

-   **vote_id**: A unique identifier for each vote cast in the system. It automatically increments for distinction.
-   **user_id**: Links the vote to the voter who cast it, with a foreign key reference to the "Users" table.
-   **vote_type_id**: Identifies the type of voting process (e.g., poll or electoral), linking back to the "Vote Types" table.
-   **candidate_id**: If the vote is for a candidate, this column links the vote to the corresponding candidate in the system.
-   **option_id**: If the vote is part of a poll, this column links to the selected option from the "Poll Options" table.
-   **vote_timestamp**: Captures the exact moment when the vote was cast, ensuring precise tracking and transparency.
-   **approved**: A flag that indicates whether the vote has been officially approved for inclusion in the final count (1 for yes, 0 for no).
